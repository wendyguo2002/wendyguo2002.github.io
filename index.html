<h2>Project 1</h2>

<h3>Description of contribution</h3>
<span>I implemented the core mechanics for enemy behaviors, 
    including the AI movement patterns for enemies like the Zoomer, Reo, Ripper, Zeb, and Skree.
    My work involved designing and scripting complex movement algorithms, 
    such aschasing mechanics. 
    Additionally, I contributed to the overall game functionality by developing the player’s weapon system and integrating key gameplay elements like capturing and releasing pets.
</span>

<h3>Technologies used</h3>
<span>I developed the game using Unity as the main game engine, 
    utilizing C# for scripting the enemy AI, player mechanics, 
    and weapon systems. 
    I implemented collision detection and physics interactions using Unity’s Rigidbody and Collider components. 
    Additionally, I worked with Unity’s WebGL build platform to make the game accessible online.
