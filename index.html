<h2>Project 1</h2>

<h3>Description of contribution</h3>
<span>I implemented the core mechanics for enemy behaviors, 
    including the AI movement patterns for enemies like the Zoomer, Reo, Ripper, Zeb, and Skree.
    My work involved designing and scripting complex movement algorithms, 
    such aschasing mechanics. 
    Additionally, I contributed to the overall game functionality by developing the player’s weapon system and integrating key gameplay elements like capturing and releasing pets.
</span>

<h3>Technologies used</h3>
<span>I developed the game using Unity as the main game engine, 
    utilizing C# for scripting the enemy AI, player mechanics, 
    and weapon systems. 
    I implemented collision detection and physics interactions using Unity’s Rigidbody and Collider components. 
    Additionally, I worked with Unity’s WebGL build platform to make the game accessible online.

<h2>Project 2</h2>

<h3>Description of contribution</h3>
<span>I developed a maze exploration game with dynamic lighting and enemy behaviors. 
    Players must navigate dark mazes by collecting shine collectibles that briefly illuminate their surroundings.
    I designed and scripted enemy AI that reacts to the player’s light radius, retreating or attacking based on visibility and proximity. 
    Enemies dynamically chase the player, adding strategic depth to managing the limited energy and navigating the maze.
    I also implemented interactive elements such as hidden doors and puzzles that shape the player’s journey through each level.
</span>

<h3>Technologies used</h3>
<span>This project was built with Unity, leveraging the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) to create realistic lighting effects and enemy behaviors.
    The enemy AI and movement patterns were implemented in C# to ensure responsive interactions with the player. 
    The game also includes an energy management system integrated with UI elements using Unity's Canvas.
    Additionally, the game was deployed using Unity’s WebGL platform to make it playable online.
